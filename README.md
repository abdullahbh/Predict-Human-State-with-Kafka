# Big Data Analytics Project Documentation

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system for collecting, processing, and analyzing smartphone sensor data using Big Data Analytics techniques. The project involves three main deliverables, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Data Collection and Labeling**
2. **Data Processing and Classification**
3. **Frontend Development and Documentation**

## Deliverables Details

### 1. Data Collection and Labeling

#### Task
- Generate and label your own data using smartphone sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope).
- Develop a basic Android or iOS app to collect data via these sensors.
- Upload the data to your laptop either via Flask API or Bluetooth.
- Label the collected data with the following categories: Standing, Walking, Running, Not with me, Phone in use.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Flutter for Native App Development.
- Sensors Plus package for accessing smartphone sensors.
- MongoDB or MySQL for data storage.


### 2. Data Processing and Classification

#### Task
- Ingest the collected data into the Kafka environment.
- Implement ML classification models (e.g., KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify labeled data.
- Compare the performance of different models.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Apache Kafka for data streaming.
- Machine Learning libraries for model implementation.


### 3. Frontend Development

#### Task
- Develop a frontend website using Flask or any other framework.
- Display live data from the connected phone via API or Bluetooth.
- Show predicted state based on previously labeled data.
- Display readings of Accelerometer and Gyroscope on the website.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Flask or alternative frameworks for frontend development.

## Conclusion

This project offers a hands-on opportunity to apply Big Data Analytics techniques to real-world data collected from smartphone sensors. By following the outlined tasks and deadlines, students will gain valuable experience in data collection, processing, analysis, and frontend development. Collaboration, originality, and thorough documentation are key to success in this project.
